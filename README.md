# Screenplay
Screen writing app, tiny+fast+offline


# Limitations
* Sadly, no web browsers currently support persistent storage, so I figured that  
the most user-friendly way would be to just allow drag and drop to open ``.screenplay`` files

# TODO (Planned Features)
* **Screenplays List**
	* allow renaming files
	* optionally allow backing up marked screenplays to the cloud
* **Global character mapping**:
	* so that you can rename characters across your screenplay in a single go
* **Dialog colors**:
	* based on characters
* **Undo/Redo**:
	* support for modification history
* **Editor**:  
	* scene heading should get pinned at the top while scrolling, explore List API's header feature
