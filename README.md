# screenplay
Screen writing app, tiny+fast+offline

# Limitations
* Sadly, no web browsers currently support persistent storage, so I figured that  
the most user-friendly way would be to just allow drag and drop to open .screenplay files

# TODO (Planned Features)
* **Global character mapping**: so that you can rename characters across your screenplay  
in a single go
* **Dialog colors**: based on characters
* **Undo/Redo**: support for modification history
